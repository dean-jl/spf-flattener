# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## 📜 Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project a respectful, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone—regardless of level of experience, technical background, or personal identity.

## 🤝 Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Showing empathy toward others

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
- Personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without consent

## 👥 Our Responsibilities

The project maintainer is not actively reviewing contributions but reserves the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.

## 🛠 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces—issues, pull requests, discussions—and also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## 📬 Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or discussion in the repository. If needed, you may also contact the maintainer privately.

## 🙌 Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.
