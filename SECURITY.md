# 🔐 Security Policy

## 🛠 Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** use the “Report a security vulnerability” button on the New Issue page—it redirects back to this page.

Instead, click [New Issue](https://github.com/dean-jl/spf-flattener/issues/new), then select **🔐 Security Report** from the list of templates.

If you're unsure whether to disclose publicly, start a thread in [Discussions → Security](https://github.com/dean-jl/spf-flattener/discussions/categories/security).

Do not include sensitive data. We’ll triage and respond promptly.  We encourage responsible disclosure and community engagement to resolve security concerns.
